[View the live project here](https://paddyw11.github.io/CI-MSP-1-PW/)

Conwy Bike Hub is a site that advertises a fictional bicycle repair shop. The shop provides a range of bicycle repair and maintenence services. The site is targeted to bicycle owners that require a repair and need a reliable service. The workshop has a waiting area allowing customers to relax whilst they wait for their repair and enjoy free coffee. The main USP is the locality to Conwy, a relaible and honest service and affordable pricing. The site will be useful for customers to find the range of services available, the prices and where the wqorkshop is located.

    * A 'shopping cart' could be utilised for customers purchasing more than one service and a checkout could confirm a booking for service(s).



## Design

### Imagery
* The hero image and services images have been chosen as they portray the purpose of the business and highlight the specific bike parts that are serviced. The hero image of the workshop shows the nature of the business as a whole and the service pictures help the user associate with their particular need. 

### Colour 
* The colour of 'dark saturated blue/vivid navy' (#2600ff) has been chosen for its association with confidence, reliability and security, three attribures required for bike mechanics and repair.
*Due to the poor colour contrast of black on blue, white has been used for font over blue. The footer bar is black (#000000) with a grey (#777777) used for the Social Media icons.  

### Typography
![Goolge Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used to choose a font-family.
![Barlow](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Barlow) was selected as a readable and clear font.
![Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icons were used throughoutt heh site, such as on the 'reasons' area and the social media icons in the footer.

### Wireframes
